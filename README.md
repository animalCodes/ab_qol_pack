# Animal's Basic Quality-Of-Life datapack

A simple minecraft datapack aiming to make certain items easier to get via tweaked recipes and loot tables.

## Craftable uncraftables

New recipes to ease the gathering of certain items, such as:

- Chainmail Armour
- Cobweb
- Glow Lichen

## Tweaked crafting results

I've always found it odd how an entire block will convert into one measly button, but no more! Now you'll get 8 buttons for your time.

Trapdoors and stairs have also had an upgrade, giving 24 and 8 respectively.

## More loot

Item drops for some mobs have been increased, and brand-new items can now be obtained, Examples:

- Bats have a high chance to drop a torch
- Silverfish can drop iron nuggets and gravel
- Husks have a low chance to drop sand
